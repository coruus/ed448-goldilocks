 * With this flag set to 1, crandom will assume that any flag
 * supported by -march and friends (MIGHT_HAVE) will actually
 * be available on the target machine (MUST_HAVE), instead of
 * trying to detect it.
 *
 * Without this flag, crandom can detect, eg, that while -mavx
 * was passed, the currint machine doesn't support AVX, and can
 * fall back to SSE2 or whatever.  But the rest of the
 * Goldilocks code doesn't support this, so it'll still crash
 * with an illegal instruction error.
 *
 * Setting this flag will make the library smaller.

 * requests, which hurts performance.

 * The advantage is that if a user process forks or is VM-
 * snapshotted, the buffer is not adjusted (FUTURE).  However,
 * with the buffer disabled, the refresh routines will stir
 * in entropy from RDTSC and/or RDRAND, making this operation
 * mostly-safe.
