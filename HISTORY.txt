September 29, 2014:
    Yesterday I put in some more architecture detection, but it should
    really be based on the arch directory, because what's in there really
    was a terrible hack.  So I've changed it to use $arch/arch_config.h
    to get WORD_BITS.
    
    I've tweaked the eBAT construction code to rename the architectures
    using test/batarch.map.  Maybe I should also rename them internally,
    but not yet.
    
    I added some new TODO.txt items.  Some folks have been asking for a
    more factored library, instead of this combined arithmetic, curve code,
    encodings and protocol all-in-one jumble.  Likewise the hash and RNG
    should be flexible.
    
    I've also been meaning to put more work in on SPAKE2EE, which would
    also mean finalizing the Elligator code.

September 18, 2014:
    Begin work on a "ref" implementation.  Currently this is just the
    arch_ref64 architecture.  The ref implementation always weak_reduces
    after arithmetic, and doesn't use vectors or other hackery.  Currently
    it still must declare field elements as vector aligned, though,
    other code outside the arch directory can be vectorized.

    Change goldilocks.c to use field_eq instead of calling deep into field
    apis.

September 6, 2014:
    Pull in minor changes from David Leon Gil and Nicholas Wilson, with
    some adjustments.  I hope the adjustments don't break their compiles.

    `make bat` now makes a bat which passes supercop-fastbuild, though
    the benchmarks are rather different from `make bench`.  I need to track
    down why.

August 4, 2014:
    Experiments and bug fixes.

    Add really_memset = memset_s (except not because I'm setting -std=c99),
    thanks David Leon Gil.  I think I put it in the right places.

    Try to work around what I think is a compiler bug in GCC -O3 on non-AVX
    platforms.  I can't seem to work around it as -Os, so I'm just flagging
    a warning (-Werror makes it an error) for now.  Will take more
    investigation.  Thanks Samuel Neves.

    Added an experimental (not ready yet!) ARM NEON implementation in
    arch_neon_experimental.  This implementation seems to work, but needs
    more testing.  It is currently asm-heavy and not GCC clean.  I am
    planning to have a flag for it to use intrinsics instead of asm;
    currently the intrinsics are commented out.  On clang this does ECDH
    in 1850kcy on my BeagleBone Black, comparable to Curve41417.  Once this
    is ready, I will probably move it to arch_neon proper, since arch_neon
    isn't particularly tuned.

July 11, 2014:
    This is mostly a cleanup release.

    Added CRANDOM_MIGHT_IS_MUST config flag (default: 1).  When set, this
    causes crandom to assume that all features in the target arch will
    be available, instead of detecting them.  This makes sense because
    the rest of the Goldilocks code is not (yet?) able to detect features.
    Also, I'd like to submit this to SUPERCOP eventually, and SUPERCOP won't
    pass -DMUST_HAVE_XXX on the command line the way the Makefile here did.
    
    Flag EXPERIMENT_CRANDOM_BUFFER_CUTOFF_BYTES to disable the crandom
    output buffer.  This buffer improves performance (very marginally at
    Goldilocks sizes), but can cause problems with forking and VM
    snapshotting.  By default, the buffer is now disabled.
    
    I've slightly tweaked the Elligator implementation (which is still
    unused) to make it easier to invert.  This makes anything using Elligator
    (i.e. nothing) incompatible with previous releases.
    
    I've been factoring "magic" constants such as curve orders, window sizes,
    etc into a few headers, to reduce the effort to port the code to other
    primes, curves, etc.  For example, I could test the Microsoft curves, and
    something like:
        x^2 + y^2 = 1 +- 5382[45] x^2 y^2 mod 2^480-2^240-1
    ("Goldeneye"? "Ridinghood"?) might be a reasonable thing to try for
    64-bit CPUs.
    
    In a similar vein, most of the internal code has been changed to say
    "field" instead of p448, so that a future version of magic.h can decide
    which field header to include.
    
    You can now `make bat` to create an eBAT in build/ed448-goldilocks.  This
    is only minimally tested, though, because SUPERCOP doesn't work on my
    machine and I'm too lazy to reverse engineer it.  It sets a new macro,
    SUPERCOP_WONT_LET_ME_OPEN_FILES, which causes goldilocks_init() to fall
    back to something horribly insecure if crandom_init_from_file raises
    EMFILE.
    
    Slightly improved documentation.
    
    Removed some old commented-out code; restored the /* C-style */ comment
    discipline.
    
    The AMD-64 version should now be GCC clean, at least for reasonably
    recent GCC (tested on OS X.9.3, Haswell, gcc-4.9).
    
    History no longer says "2104".

May 3, 2014:
    Minor changes to internal routines mean that this version is not
    compatible with the previous one.

    Added ARM NEON code.
    
    Added the ability to precompute multiples of a partner's public key.  This
    takes slightly longer than a signature verification, but reduces future
    verifications with the precomputed key by ~63% and ECDH by ~70%.
    
        goldilocks_precompute_public_key
        goldilocks_destroy_precomputed_public_key
        goldilocks_verify_precomputed
        goldilocks_shared_secret_precomputed
    
    The precomputation feature are is protected by a macro
        GOLDI_IMPLEMENT_PRECOMPUTED_KEYS
    which can be #defined to 0 to compile these functions out.  Unlike most
    of Goldilocks' functions, goldilocks_precompute_public_key uses malloc()
    (and goldilocks_destroy_precomputed_public_key uses free()).
    
    Changed private keys to be derived from just the symmetric part.  This
    means that you can compress them to 32 bytes for cold storage, or derive
    keypairs from crypto secrets from other systems.
        goldilocks_derive_private_key
        goldilocks_underive_private_key
        goldilocks_private_to_public
    
    Fixed a number of bugs related to vector alignment on Sandy Bridge, which
    has AVX but uses SSE2 alignment (because it doesn't have AVX2).  Maybe I
    should just switch it to use AVX2 alignment?
    
    Beginning to factor out curve-specific magic, so as to build other curves
    with the Goldilocks framework.  That would enable fair tests against eg
    E-521, Ed25519 etc.  Still would be a lot of work.
    
    More thorough testing of arithmetic.  Now uses GMP for testing framework,
    but not in the actual library.
    
    Added some high-level tests for the whole library, including some (bs)
    negative testing.  Obviously, effective negative testing is a very difficult
    proposition in a crypto library.

March 29, 2014:
    Added a test directory with various tests.  Currently testing SHA512 Monte
    Carlo, compatibility of the different scalarmul functions, and some
    identities on EC point ops.  Began moving these tests out of benchmarker.
    
    Added scan-build support.
    
    Improved some internal interfaces.  Made a structure for Barrett primes
    instead of passing parameters individually.  Moved some field operations
    to places that make more sense, eg Barrett serialize and deserialize.  The
    deserialize operation now checks that its argument is in [0,q).
    
    Added more documentation.
    
    Changed the names of a bunch of functions.  Still not entirely consistent,
    but getting more so.
    
    Some minor speed improvements.  For example, multiply is now a couple cycles
    faster.
    
    Added a hackish attempt at thread-safety and initialization sanity checking
    in the Goldilocks top-level routines.
    
    Fixed some vector alignment bugs.  Compiling with -O0 should now work.
    
    Slightly simplified recode_wnaf.

    Add a config.h file for future configuration.  EXPERIMENT flags moved here.
    
    I've decided against major changes to SHA512 for the moment.  They add speed
    but also significantly bloat the code, which is going to hurt L1 cache
    performance.  Perhaps we should link to OpenSSL if a faster SHA512 is desired.
    
    Reorganize the source tree into src, test; factor arch stuff into src/arch_*.
    
    Make most of the code 32-bit clean.  There's now a 32-bit generic and 32-bit
    vectorless ARM version.  No NEON version yet because I don't have a test
    machine (could use my phone in a pinch I guess?).  The 32-bit version still
    isn't heavily optimized, but on ARM it's using a nicely reworked signed/phi-adic
    multiplier.  The squaring is also based on this, but could really stand some
    improvement.
    
    When passed an even exponent (or extra doubles), the Montgomery ladder should
    now be accept points if and only if they lie on the curve.  This needs
    additional testing, but it passes the zero bit exponent test.
    
    On 32-bit, use 8x4x14 instead of 5x5x18 table organization.  Probably there's
    a better heuristic.

March 5, 2014:
    First revision.
    
    Private keys are now longer.  They now store a copy of the public key, and
    a secret symmetric key for signing purposes.
    
    Signatures are now supported, though like everything else in this library,
    their format is not stable.  They use a deterministic Schnorr mode,
    similar to EdDSA.  Precomputed low-latency signing is not supported (yet?).
    The hash function is SHA-512.
    
    The deterministic hashing mode needs to be changed to HMAC (TODO!).  It's
    currently envelope-MAC.
    
    Probably in the future there will be a distinction between ECDH key and
    signing keys (and possibly also MQV keys etc).
    
    Began renaming internal functions.  Removing p448_ prefixes from EC point
    operations.  Trying to put the verb first.  For example,
    "p448_isogeny_un_to_tw" is now called "twist_and_double".
    
    Began documenting with Doxygen.  Use "make doc" to make a very incomplete
    documentation directory.
    
    There have been many other internal changes.

Feb 21, 2014:
    Initial import and benchmarking scripts.
    
    Keygen and ECDH are implemented, but there's no hash function.
